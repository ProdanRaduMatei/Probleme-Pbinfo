# 📘 PbInfo Problem Solutions

This repository contains my complete collection of solutions to programming problems from [PbInfo.ro](https://www.pbinfo.ro), the most widely used Romanian platform for practicing algorithmic problems and preparing for informatics contests.

## 📌 About

I began solving problems on PbInfo during high school as part of my preparation for the Romanian Olympiad in Informatics (ONI) and various local and national programming contests. Since then, I have continued solving problems on the platform throughout my academic journey to further improve my algorithmic thinking, C++ proficiency, and competitive programming skills.

📈 I am currently ranked **in the Top 80 nationally** on the PbInfo platform, based on problem-solving activity and performance.

This repository serves as a personal archive and reference, showcasing my progress and dedication to structured problem solving from high school until university.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by **problem type**, **difficulty**, or **topic**, depending on how the platform categorizes them. Some directories may follow naming conventions such as:

- `1000+` – Problems by ID range
- `Structuri de date` – Problems grouped by data structure
- `Backtracking`, `Greedy`, `Divide et Impera`, `Dinamica` – By algorithmic paradigm
- `ONI` – Specific folders for Olympiad-level problems
- `Easy/Medium/Hard` – Difficulty-based folders (optional)

Each solution is implemented in C++, and the file name usually matches the problem name or ID for clarity.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: [PbInfo.ro](https://www.pbinfo.ro)
- **Tools**: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, and command-line testing with custom inputs

## 🎯 Purpose

- Reinforce fundamental algorithms and data structures
- Practice IO optimization, edge cases, and constraints handling
- Prepare for informatics olympiads and technical interviews
- Track personal growth and share with others for learning purposes

## 📌 Notes

- Each solution attempts to pass **all test cases** and adhere to the **time and memory constraints** set by PbInfo.
- Some solutions include **comments** or **explanations**, especially for more advanced or tricky problems.
- I continuously update this repository as I solve more problems or improve existing solutions.
